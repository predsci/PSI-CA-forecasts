methods_long: "Deterministic fit of a compartmental SIHR model to weekly, CA region level, \
  \ hospitalization incidence profiles, followed by stochastic simulations using the inferred\
  \ parameter distributions. The ‘H’ compartment is divided into two compartments to ensure\
  \ the correct generation time for the Infectious compartment and proper fitting of the portion\
  \ of infectious individuals that are hospitalized. For each of the five CA regions, the model\
  \ fit is inferred by an MCMC procedure and run forward at a weekly cadence."
